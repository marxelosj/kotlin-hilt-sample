# Sample Dagger Hilt

Repository that contains a sample of Dagger Hilt.

## What is Dagger Hilt?
Dagger Hilt is a dependency injection framework perform operations in compile-time for Android. Hilt works by code generating your Dagger setup code for you. This takes away most of the boilerplate of using Dagger and really just leaves the aspects of defining how to create objects and where to inject them.
Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.

## The goals of Hilt are:
* To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps.
* To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup, readability/understanding, and code sharing between apps.
* To provide an easy way to provision different bindings to various build types (e.g. testing, debug, or release).
